# Meta-Tac-Toe
Meta-Tac-Toe is an exciting twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game board is a 3x3 grid, and each cell in this grid contains another 3x3 grid known as a "small board". The objective is to win the "meta-board" by securing three small boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
